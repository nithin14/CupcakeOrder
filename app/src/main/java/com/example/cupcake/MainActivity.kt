/**
 * TO DO IN FUTURE
 *
 * Extend the Cupcake app with your own variations on the cupcake order flow. Examples:

Offer a special flavor that has some special conditions around it, such as not being available for same day pickup.
Ask the user for their name for the cupcake order.
Allow the user to select multiple cupcake flavors for their order if the quantity is more than 1 cupcake.
